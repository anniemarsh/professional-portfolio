## Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

### Description
My professional portfolio contains my name, image and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. My navigation links scroll to their proper sections. My work contains two deployed URLs to Run Buddy & SEO Optimization and two work-in-progress applications. Run Buddy is the first and largest image represented on the application. When hovered over, my application image previews zoom in. When clicked on, my application opens to a new tab. My resume clicks through to my LinkedIn account where potential employers may read through my expereinces.
